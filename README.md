# Call Transcription using Vosk (Offline ASR)

This project performs offline speech-to-text transcription on call recordings using the Vosk ASR model. It supports converting audio files (WAV/MP3) into text and subtitle formats such as `.txt`, `.srt`, `.vtt`, and `.tsv`.

The setup is CPU-friendly and works fully offline after downloading the model.
